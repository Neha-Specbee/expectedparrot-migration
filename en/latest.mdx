This page provides documentation for **Expected Parrot Domain-Specific Language (EDSL)**, an open-source Python package for performing research with AI agents and language models, and **Coop**, a platform for creating, storing and sharing AI research projects, and validating LLM results with human respondents.

- EDSL is available to download from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/edsl/) (run pip install edsl). The source code is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/expectedparrot/edsl).
- [Create an account](https://www.expectedparrot.com/login) to post and share content, run surveys with LLMs and humans, and store results at the Expected Parrot server. Learn more about [how it works](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/coop.html) and start [exploring](https://www.expectedparrot.com/content/explore).

## Key features

- Simplified access to hundreds of models
	- A single API key lets you conduct research with many popular models at once. [Learn more](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/remote_inference.html).

- Collaboration features
	- Use [Coop](https://www.expectedparrot.com/login) to create, store and share your research projects seamlessly.

- Data integrations
	- Easily import, analyze and extend many types of data to use with your research. [Learn more](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/scenarios.html).

- Hybrid human-AI surveys

- Built-in analysis tools
	- Readily visualize, analyze and compare responses. [Learn more](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/results.html).

## Use cases

Our tools simplify survey creation, experiment execution and response analysis. Common use cases include:

- Data labeling
	- Use AI to answer qualitative and quantitative questions about your data, and extract insights. See [examples](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/notebooks/data_labeling_example.html).

- Market research
	- Gather insights on consumer preferences, behaviors and trends. Simulate customer personas with AI agents and analyze their responses. See [examples](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/notebooks/yoga_studio_name_survey.html).

	- Assess user satisfaction, usability and engagement. Use AI agents to simulate user profiles and analyze their feedback on products or services. See [examples](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/notebooks/nps_survey.html).

- Integrate human and AI data
	- Combine human responses with AI-generated responses to create richer datasets. See [examples](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/notebooks/import_agents.html).

- Analyze survey data
	- Analyze survey data with built-in methods. Simulate follow-up interviews with respondents. See [examples](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/notebooks/analyze_evaluations.html).	

- Compare model performance
	- Compare the performance of different language models on the same task. See [examples](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/notebooks/models_scoring_models.html).

- Social science research
	- Explore hypotheses, gather qualitative or quantitative data and generate new data using AI. See [examples](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/notebooks/social_science_research.html).

## Getting started

To use EDSL, you need to install the package and choose how to access language models. Please see the links in the steps below for more details:

<Steps>
<Step title="Install EDSL">
	Run the following command to install the package:
	```bash
	! uv pip install edsl -q
	```
	See [Installation](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/installation.html#installation) instructions for more details.
</Step>
<Step title="Create a Coop account">
	Create an account](https://www.expectedparrot.com/login) to access the Expected Parrot server, free storage and special features and collaboration tools.
	You can also log into Expected Parrot and import dependencies by running:
	```python
	from edsl import Login
	login()
	```
</Step>
<Step title="Manage API keys for language models">
	Your account comes with a key that allows you to run surveys with all [available models](https://www.expectedparrot.com/models.html). You can also provide and share your own keys from service providers.
	See instructions on [Managing Keys](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/api_keys.html#api-keys) for details and options.
</Step>
<Step title="Run a survey">
	Read the [Starter Tutorial](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/starter_tutorial.html#starter-tutorial) and [download a notebook](https://www.expectedparrot.com/content/179b3a78-2505-4568-acd9-c09d18953288) to create a survey and run it. See examples for many use cases and [tips](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/checklist.html) on using EDSL effectively in the documentation.
</Step>
<Step title="Validate with real respondents">
	Choose when to add a human-in-the-loop by automatically launching a web-based survey to share with real respondents. Learn about collecting responses in the [Survey Builder](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/survey_builder.html#survey-builder) and [Humanize](https://docs.expectedparrot.com/en/latest/humanize.html#humanize) sections.
